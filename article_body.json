{"article_title": ["China denies plan to hit Alibaba with $1B fine"], "article_body": "China has denied it was planning to hit e-commerce giant Alibaba with a record fine of almost $1 billion for allegedly flouting monopoly rules, as authorities turned up the pressure on the country’s vast technology sector.Alibaba, China's largest online shopping portal, has been in the crosshairs of authorities in recent months over concerns of its reach into the daily finances of ordinary Chinese people.The market's regulator on Friday denied it was planning to fine the company almost $1 billion for anti-competitive behaviour, as reported by the , who cited unnamed sources \"familiar\" with the matter.However, on Friday it hit 12 other tech firms — including giants Tencent, Baidu and ByteDance — with symbolic fines for allegedly flouting monopoly rules.Tencent was fined $77,000 for its 2018 investment in online education app Yuanfudao without seeking prior government approval for the deal, the State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement on Friday.Search giant Baidu has to pay the same amount for acquiring consumer electronics maker Ainemo under the radar in 2014.Beijing has warned it will take an increasingly ruthless approach to antitrust questions.Premier Li Keqiang last week said the government would \"strengthen anti-monopoly laws\" and \"prevent the disorderly expansion of capital.\"Analysts said Friday's blizzard of fines send a strong signal of the Communist Party's dominion over the country's tech landscape.\"These penalties send a message: the economy and everything within it must comply with the state’s directive,\" Alex Capri, a senior fellow at the National University of Singapore's business school, said.Capri said heavy-handed regulations will rein in the ability of tech firms to gobble up market share and influence with unchecked acquisitions.\nThe ongoing squeeze on Alibaba — one of China's most influential companies — is the latest sign that the leadership is ready to deflate the ambitions of big tech firms in a runaway internet sector. reported on Thursday that officials are considering levying a hefty penalty against the company that could top the $975 million paid by US chipmaker Qualcomm in 2015 — the biggest known fine for anticompetitive practices in China.But the regulator in charge of the case said there was no truth to the story.\"If it's not there (on our website), it's not (true),\" a spokesperson for the State Administration for Market Regulation said.Still, the company's legal troubles linger. Problems began after comments in October by billionaire founder Jack Ma in which he laid into China's convoluted regulatory system.In November, financial regulators pulled the plug on the record $35 billion Hong Kong-Shanghai initial public offering of Alibaba's online payment subsidiary Ant Group.A month later, officials opened an investigation into Alibaba's business practices, deemed anticompetitive, and Ma disappeared from public view until mid-January.The company, based in the eastern city of Hangzhou, last month said it was \"fully cooperating\" with the investigation by the State Administration for Market Regulation.Regulators are also investigating whether the conglomerate should divest assets unrelated to its main online retail business, reported, without offering details.An Alibaba spokesperson declined to comment on the report.The company has come under fire in the past for allegedly forbidding its merchants from listing on rival e-commerce platforms.Once finalised, measures against Alibaba will need to be approved by China's top leadership.Regulators have already told Ant Group to change its business model and hack back its lending, insurance and wealth management services.Alibaba saw profits jump 52 percent to $12.2 billion over the last three months of 2020, despite the official crackdown.\n", "article_description": ["The Chinese market’s regulator denies planning a record fine for the e-commerce giant over anti-competitive behaviour as reported by the Wall Street Journal but has hit 12 other tech firms for allegedly flouting monopoly rules."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/china-denies-plan-to-hit-alibaba-with-1b-fine-44951"},

Vaccines: 6 percent. Syringes: 21 percent. Specialised freezers that can store the Pfizer vaccine at minus 70 Celsius: 30 percent.\nNew Zealand last year removed tariffs from such virus supplies. Vitalis said APEC can act more nimbly than other groups like the World Trade Organisation.“No international organisation at the moment has agreed on a set of medical products,” Vitalis said. “You'd think that it was pretty obvious that face masks and syringes would be a vital part of it.”As well as ending tariffs, Vitalis is also hoping that forum countries will agree on ways to make it easier to transport vaccines and medical supplies across borders, for example by removing export restrictions and simplifying customs procedures.“The response needs to be urgent,” Vitalis said.The push builds on a more generalised agreement the 21 nations made at last year's forum in Malaysia. It comes ahead of the final first-round meetings of senior officials on Thursday and Friday.Similar to Malaysia, New Zealand is hosting APEC meetings online rather than in person due to the pandemic. The months of forum meetings will conclude with a leaders' meeting and declaration in November.Vitalis said members are also working on ways to improve food security during the pandemic.He said the forum is waiting to see exactly how the incoming US administration will engage with it.“We are hopeful, though, that on some of the key things that New Zealanders care about, that we will find common ground,” he said, citing issues like climate change.\n", "article_description": ["New Zealand hopes APEC members will quickly agree on a list of products that should have tariffs removed and that the list will then be used as a template by other nations around the world."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/new-zealand-seeks-urgent-end-to-global-tariffs-on-virus-supplies-44919"},
{"article_title": ["China's export growth at highest level in decades after hit from pandemic"], "article_body": "China's export growth has jumped to the highest in over two decades, official data showed, with imports also surging in a sharp bounce-back from the coronavirus outbreak that had brought activity to a near halt.Exports spiked 60.6 percent on-year in the January-February period, well above analysts' expectations, while imports rose 22.2 percent, official data showed on Sunday.Electronics and textile exports such as masks contributed to the spike in outbound shipments, as demand for work-from-home supplies and protective gear against the virus outbreak soared during the pandemic.The latest figures stand in stark contrast to last year's fall of around 17 percent in exports and 4 percent drop in imports.The country struggled to contain the spread of Covid-19 early on, with consumers staying home and businesses seeing a slow return to operations.The customs administration said comparison to last year is also likely to have bolstered the latest figures, saying in a statement that the \"low base is one of the reasons for the larger increase this year.\"China’s Exports Set for Fastest Start to Year Since 2007Bloomberg - China’s exports for the first two months of the year, supercharged by medical equipment and work-from-home gear, likely grew at the fastest pace since 2007. On Sunday, official data showed that electronics exports rose 54.1 percent, while textiles including masks rose 50.2 percent.China's overall trade surplus came in at $103.3 billion, its customs administration said.Meanwhile, the country's trade surplus with the US — a key point of contention during the trade war pursued by former president Donald Trump — doubled from the same period last year to $51.3 billion.Chinese authorities started combining January and February trade data last year, while it battled the coronavirus outbreak.This is in line with how some other indicators are released, to smooth over distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday, which can fall in either month.China's foreign trade data remained strong despite the \"off-season,\" the customs authority said Sunday.Trade was also high due to a recovery in production and consumption in major economies such as Europe and the United States amid the coronavirus pandemic, as well as improvements in domestic consumption.Although business activity usually falls during the Lunar New Year period when workers return to their hometowns, official appeals to avoid travelling this year to keep the Covid-19 outbreak in check supported production, the customs administration added.\"Many enterprises in major foreign trade provinces such as Guangdong and Zhejiang maintained production during the Lunar New Year,\" it said. \"Market demand is expected to rebound further.\"Some companies have also been stocking up on goods such as integrated circuits, iron ore and crude oil imports.\"Global electronics demand has risen strongly due to the global shift to remote working and online shopping,\" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit.This had driven demand for electronics products such as laptops, mobile phones and wearables, he said.Meanwhile, the strong import growth also reflected a \"normalisation of consumer spending\" in China, he told AFP, after a severe slump due to lockdowns.Analysts have warned the demand boom for protective equipment supporting Chinese exports could fade as pandemic controls improve globally, although this may not happen too soon.\"The pandemic might have already changed people's behaviour... I think this kind of demand will still be in place for some time,\" said ANZ Research senior China economist Betty Wang.But Chinese authorities cautioned Sunday that, given global uncertainties, there is \"a long way to go towards steady growth in foreign trade.\"", "article_description": ["Exports spiked 60.6 percent on-year in the January-February period, well above analysts' expectations, while imports rose 22.2 percent, with electronics and textile exports such as masks contributed to the spike in outbound shipments."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/asia/china-s-export-growth-at-highest-level-in-decades-after-hit-from-pandemic-44791"},

{"article_title": ["US loses 140,000 jobs, first monthly loss since spring"], "article_body": "US employers have shed jobs last month for the first time since April, cutting 140,000 positions, clear evidence that the economy is faltering as the viral pandemic tightens its grip on consumers and businesses.At the same time, the unemployment rate stayed at 6.7 percent, the first time it hasn't fallen since April.Friday’s figures from the Labor Department suggest that employers have rehired roughly all the workers they can afford to after having laid off more than 22 million in the spring — the worst such loss on record. With consumer spending barely growing over the past few months, most companies have little incentive to hire. The economy still has 9.9 million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic sent it sinking into a deep recession nearly a year ago.The pandemic will likely continue to weaken the economy through the winter and perhaps early spring. But many economists, along with the Federal Reserve’s policymakers, say they think that once the coronavirus vaccines are more widely distributed, a broad recovery should take hold in the second half of the year. The incoming Biden administration, along with a now fully Democratic-controlled House and Senate, is also expected to push rescue aid and spending measures that could accelerate growth.For now, the renewed surge in virus cases, as well as cold weather, has caused millions of consumers to avoid eating out, shopping and traveling. Re-imposed business restrictions have shut down numerous restaurants, bars, and other venues.Economists at TD Securities estimate that more than half the states have restricted gatherings to 10 or fewer people, up from about a quarter in September. New York City and California, among others, placed strict new limits on restaurants last month.In recent months, retailers have been especially hurt by the slump in consumer spending. Debit and credit card data tracked by JPMorgan Chase, based on 30 million accounts, shows that Americans slowed their purchases during the holiday shopping season. Such spending was six percent lower in December compared with a year ago. That was worse than in October, when card spending was down just two percent from the previous year.Restaurant traffic has also dropped, according to the reservations website OpenTable. Seated dining is down 60 percent this week compared with a year ago, much worse than two months earlier, when they were down about 35 percent.The $900 billion financial aid package that Congress enacted last month should also help propel a recovery, economists say. It will provide a $300-a-week federal jobless benefit on top of an average weekly state benefit of about $320. In addition, millions of Americans stand to receive $600 payments, and the Treasury Department said on Thursday that 8 million of those payments were going out this week.Late on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs upgraded its forecast for economic growth this year to a robust 6.4 percent from its previous estimate of 5.9 percent. Its upgrade was based in part on the expectation that the Biden administration will implement more stimulus.Still, for now, about 11 million people are officially unemployed. Millions more have stopped looking for work, either because they’re discouraged about their prospects or worried about contracting the coronavirus, and aren’t counted as unemployed.Friday’s monthly jobs report, the last of Donald Trump’s presidency, shows that the nation has 3 million fewer jobs than it did four years earlier. That makes Trump the first president since Herbert Hoover (1929-1933), early in the Great Depression, to preside over a net loss of jobs.All the job losses during the Trump administration occurred after the pandemic struck. Before then, the unemployment rate had fallen to a 50-year low of 3.5 percent.

{"article_title": ["Inflation-hedge, risk-on bet: What’s behind bitcoin’s 2020 rally?"], "article_body": "Bitcoin, with a history of vertiginous ascents and steep drops, is close to taking out its record peak of near $20,000, having climbed almost 160 percent this year. Its gains in November alone are more than 30 percent.Here’s the story of bitcoin’s 2020 rise:As central banks and governments unleashed the money-printing presses and spending taps to combat the damage from the Covid-19 pandemic, plentiful liquidity has lifted assets from emerging currencies and junk bonds to bitcoin and stocks.Assets under management (AUM) at Grayscale, the world’s largest digital currency manager, have soared to a record $10.4 billion, up more than 75 percent from September. Its bitcoin fund is up 85 percent.Smaller rival CoinShares says its AUM has climbed more than 150 percent this year to $1.3 billion.More broadly, high savings rates have sent money flooding into investment funds, potentially sparking interest in bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier.JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou says there are signs of family offices, which manage money for wealthy people, allocating towards the cryptocurrency.With governments and central banks in full stimulus mode, some observers reckon bitcoin is a useful safeguard against inflation – with supply capped at 21 million, its scarcity gives it an innate value.Some who buy gold to hedge inflation risk may be turning to crypto, JPM’s Panigirtozoglou said, adding: “There is a reassessment of bitcoin about its value here as an alternative currency, as an alternative to gold.”But bitcoin’s rise outstrips gold’s gains of 20 percent or so, while an inflation-linked government bonds index is up 4 percent.And its rally has sped up in recent weeks even as gold has flatlined, and the resurgent pandemic makes a growth and inflation recovery a distant prospect.\nPart of the gains may be due to growing acceptance of bitcoin as a payments system and by a broader range of investors.Bitcoin has jumped by half since PayPal said last month it would open its network to cryptocurrencies, meaning users could spend bitcoin at its 26 million merchants. That fanned hopes it could catch on as a way to pay.Traders who say there is more participation by bigger investors point to lower levels of volatility than during the 2017 bubble. Ten-day price swings against the dollar between end-June and mid-November – a period when bitcoin prices nearly doubled – were well under historical averages.“It’s still largely retail, but it’s becoming more efficient, mature, and I see more professional participants,” said Andrea Leccese of crypto fund Bluesky Capital.\n", "article_description": ["Bitcoin is in the headlines, re-kindling a debate over its true role and the drivers behind its latest scintillating rally."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/inflation-hedge-risk-on-bet-what-s-behind-bitcoin-s-2020-rally-41665"},

The new phone also will boast several new camera features, including a tool for taking portraits in low lighting and a wide-angle lens.But perhaps the Pixel 5's biggest selling point will be its price — $700, a markdown of $100 from last year's model.The phone, available October 15, is coming out two months after Google introduced a budget version, the Pixel 4a, that sells for $350. Google also revealed on Wednesday that it will make a 5G version of the Pixel 4a that will sell for $500, aimed at consumers who want faster connections while they also watch their budgets during a recession brought on by the pandemic.Apple also is selling a cheaper version of the iPhone for $400.Google has had more success with a hardware lineup called Chromecast, that streams online video on TVs. But Chromecast also faces a wide array of competition from similar streaming devices made by Roku, Amazon and Apple.In an attempt to differentiate itself from the rest of the pack, Google’s next Chromecast will include a new service tying together many of its services in a way that's designed to make it easier for viewers to sift through TV channels and streaming services to find something they want to watch.The service, called “Google TV,” includes the company’s other big-screen software, Android TV, as well as its industry-leading search engine, Chrome browser, and YouTube TV, a bundle of programming similar to what cable and satellite providers have long provided.

He emerged at about 2:40 am Tuesday and briefly greeted reporters but did not answer when asked how he felt about the decision.Lee then left in a black sedan.The merger transaction was seen as helping ensure a smooth third-generational power transfer to Lee, a scion of Samsung's founding family.Chaebol families often have only a small ownership stake in their empires, but maintain control through complex webs of cross-shareholdings between units.Lee was the largest shareholder in Cheil Industries, and critics say Samsung sought to artificially lower the price of C&T to give him a bigger stake in the merged entity, a key part of the Samsung structure, consolidating his grip on the conglomerate.Last week, the Samsung group rejected media reports of price manipulation as \"groundless\", saying in a statement Lee did not take part in \"any illegal acts\".The prosecutors' request came weeks after Lee issued a wide-ranging apology for company misconduct and promised to end the line of family succession.Lee, 51, has effectively been at the helm of Samsung, South Korea's biggest business group, since his father and Samsung group boss Lee Kun-hee suffered a heart attack in 2014.He was jailed for five years in 2017 in connection with Park's corruption scandal but was released a year later on appeal before the country's top court ordered him to face a new trial.Samsung's overall turnover is equivalent to a fifth of the national gross domestic product, making it crucial to South Korea's economic health.The company reported a slight fall in first-quarter net profit at 4.88 trillion won ($4 billion), citing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.But Samsung, which saw operations suspended at 11 overseas assembly lines, has warned of further falls to come as consumer demand is \"significantly\" hit by the disease.", "article_description": ["The request of an arrest warrant for the heir of South Korean Samsung empire was declined by the court due to lack of sufficient probable cause over the controversial merger, but his retrial on charges of bribery and embezzlement continues."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/heir-of-samsung-empire-avoids-arrest-over-controversial-merger-37103"},

We think the worst is behind them,\" Levine said in a note to clients.Last year, the San Francisco tech firm said \"bugs\" in its software used to deliver targeted ads had dragged down revenue.It has changed the way it measures its user base, now reporting only \"monetisable daily active users,\" which rose sharply in the quarter.That figure included 31 million in the United States and 121 million internationally, with both categories gaining.Twitter said the drop in profit compared with a year ago reflected a tax benefit in 2018 that boosted net income by more than $100 million.The platform has been seeking to expand its user base beyond celebrities, journalists and politicians as it moves to curb content deemed manipulative or abusive.\"Twitter's strong performance in revenue shows advertisers are confident in the platform's reach despite some of the product issues earlier in the year,\" said eMarketer analyst Nazmul Islam.\"A reason for the confidence is probably continued growth of monetisable daily active users, which spiked up again in the fourth quarter.\"Islam added that Twitter's moves to ban political ads and curb the spread of manipulated media such as \"deepfake\" videos, \"should resonate positively with users and continue the growth in engagement in the next quarter.\"Earlier this week, Twitter unveiled a fresh effort to reduce the spread of manipulated content including \"deepfake\" videos as part of a move to fight misinformation which could result in violence or other harm.The new policy calls for a mix of warning \"labels\" for tweets that include manipulated images or video and removal of the tweets.The move comes amid growing concerns over \"deepfake\" videos altered using artificial intelligence, along with other kinds of manipulation to deceive social media users to influence elections or promote violence.Dorsey repeated his claim that an important priority for Twitter will be \"increase healthy public conversation\" by rooting out inappropriate content and misinformation.\"Misleading information is probably the biggest challenge facing us in our industry,\" he said.Chief financial officer Ned Segal said the past quarter was \"a strong finish to the year\" and added that Twitter will be expanding its workforce by some 20 per cent this year.Dorsey said that as part of the growth, Twitter will be seeking a \"more distributed workforce\" with more people outside its San Francisco base.\"We are a global service that requires global perspective,\" he said\"We need people from around the world to work with us.\"Dorsey, who has announced plans to spend part of the year living in Africa, said he won't be hampered by his travel.\"We do need to figure out how to build a company that is distributed, that is not burdened by time zones but advantaged by them,\" he said.", "article_description": ["The social media group said it ended the year with 152 million \"monetisable\" daily active users – its preferred measure of its base – up 21 percent from a year earlier."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/twitter-surges-as-global-user-growth-revives-33570"},

It will be my last couture show. You have to come, you can't miss that ... but, but, but, I assure you, Gaultier Paris will go on, the haute couture will continue.\"I have a new concept. I will tell you about it later, all the little secrets. To be continued! Kisses, kisses.\"Gaultier, 67, stopped designing ready-to-wear clothes in 2015 to concentrate on haute couture — extravagant handmade clothes which only the world's richest women can afford.But as late as last year the maverick insisted that he had no intention of hanging up his scissors — although he despaired of animal rights activists pressuring him to stop using furs.\"I really like the feel of fur,\" he told AFP, as he confessed that he was wavering about dropping furs from his shows.\"We are in an age when there is too much of everything, so we shouldn't be killing animals ... I love animals, though I draw the line at crocodiles,\" he said.While his couture business owned by the Catalan luxury conglomerate Puig was never a huge money maker, his perfumes — often featuring his impossibly handsome sailors — continue to be bestsellers.A child fashion prodigy, Gaultier said he starting by making showgirl outfits for his teddy bear.He was personal assistant to French fashion magnate Pierre Cardin at 18, and rose to fame in the 1980s alongside designers like Thierry Mugler when the Paris fashion scene was at its most decadent.Gaultier then carved out a parallel TV career as the co-presenter of a cheeky series, \"Eurotrash.\"He was also the industry's jester in chief. In a world riddled with snobbery and pretension, he had the common touch — poking fun at himself and fashion's myriad follies.In 2018, he staged his own hit cabaret show based loosely on his life story called \"Fashion Freak Show,\" at the Folies Bergere theatre in Paris. hailed it as \"a fabulous fiesta of fabric and flesh\" when it transferred to London last year.It included a key moment that was to change his life — the first time he laid eyes on a corset in his grandmother's wardrobe.He traced his fascination to corsetry and bondage to that moment — and both would be recurring motifs in a career also replete with leather togas and tutus, feathers and all sorts of outsiders and freaks.Hugely loved within the fashion world, Gaultier pioneered using plus-sized models and welcomed \"all shapes, sizes and sexualities\" on his catwalk.A spokeswoman for his brand told AFP the designer would be back, but like the veteran Japanese creator Kenzo — who has moved into interior design — it would be in other areas.", "article_description": ["The flamboyant creator said he would be bowing out on Wednesday with a big party to mark his 50 years in the business after his latest collection hits the catwalk."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/art-culture/jean-paul-gaultier-to-retire-as-fashion-designer-33034"},
{"article_title": ["Japan vows to improve border checks, bail after Ghosn flight"], "article_body": "Japan's justice minister vowed on Monday to strengthen border departure checks and review bail conditions after Nissan's former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, fled the country.Masako Mori told reporters at a news conference the ministry has already acted to prevent a recurrence but declined to give details.She was asked about reports that Ghosn had hidden in a box and that baggage checks at a regional airport might have been insufficient.Ghosn skipped bail while awaiting trial on various financial misconduct allegations and later said from Lebanon that he did it to escape injustice.Mori declined to say who might be held responsible for such a high-profile flight, stressing it was still under investigation.She said Ghosn left illegally, denouncing it as an “unjustifiable\" crime.\"Japan’s justice system allows investigating the facts while it ensures the individual basic human rights at the same time,\" Mori told reporters at the ministry.“It is set with appropriate procedures and it is operated appropriately.\"But she acknowledged the case was being looked at under an ongoing review of the nation's judicial system, including introducing electronic tethers to monitor those out on bail.“We are aware of the criticisms,” Mori said, referring to human rights advocates' descriptions of Japan's legal system as “hostage justice.”Ghosn and others say Japan's system takes too long and is inhumane. Ghosn was banned from meeting with his wife while out on bail. Preparing for his trial has taken about a year, and a date has not been set. Ghosn was detained, twice, for a total of 130 days before he was released on bail a second time.Mori said each nation has its own judicial system and arrests are rarer in Japan than in other countries, suggesting arrests are made only when the authorities are fairly confident they have a case.“Simple comparisons are misleading,” she said.Takashi Takano, one of Ghosn's lawyers in Japan, said he felt sad and betrayed Ghosn didn't try to win a verdict of innocence in court, but also expressed an understanding how Ghosn might have lost hope with not only the prosecutors but the entire Japanese judicial system.Lawyer Yuichi Kaido said he was troubled by what he saw as the growing negative public reaction of demanding bail be refused for foreign suspects, noting Japanese don't empathize with Ghosn's actions at all.He said in an online statement he feared Japan wouldn't be able to bear the overwhelming international criticism of its legal system, which Ghosn will likely continue in Lebanon, and instead grow even more insular and rigid in its views.Details of Ghosn's stunning escape last week are unclear. But Turkish airline company MNG Jet said two of its planes were used illegally, first flying him from Osaka, Japan, to Istanbul, and then on to Beirut, where he arrived last Monday and has not been seen since.Lebanon has said he entered legally with a French passport.Ghosn promised to talk to reporters on Wednesday. His lawyers in Japan said they knew nothing about the escape and felt betrayed by his action.Once an auto industry superstar, Ghosn was first arrested in November 2018. While out on bail, he was living in a home in an upscale part of Tokyo under strict surveillance as part of the conditions for his release. That raises questions about how he left undetected.Security cameras at his home operated 24 hours a day, but the footage only had to be submitted to the court on a monthly basis, according to lawyers' documents detailing Ghosn's bail conditions.Ghosn had been charged with under-reporting his future compensation and breach of trust in diverting Nissan money for his personal gain. He insists he is innocent.His bail has been revoked, and Interpol has issued a wanted notice. Japan does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon, but Mori left open the possibility Japan could seek Ghosn's return.But such a return so far appears unlikely, and Japan's options are limited.Mori stressed that any retaliatory action, such as economic sanctions, must be decided on very carefully.She also declined to say whether Japan contacted the U.S. or France for help, and how they might be working together.“It is indeed possible to ask for extradition of criminals based on the principle of reciprocity,\" she said in reply to a reporter's question about Lebanon.“But, upon doing that, we need to carefully study whether it is possible to guarantee this principle of reciprocity and their internal justice system.”", "article_description": ["Japan's Justice Minister, Masako Mori, vowed to strengthen border departure checks and review bail conditions  so they can prevent recurrence of any escape act like  Nissan's former chairman."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/japan-vows-to-improve-border-checks-bail-after-ghosn-flight-32733"},

Italy’s tax police carried out checks at Gucci’s Florence headquarters and Milan offices in 2017, and drew up the report that has now been handed to Kering, a source close to the investigation said.Kering has consistently denied avoiding tax, saying its activities were fully compliant with all tax obligations.In its statement on Friday, the group said the Italian tax authorities’ findings for the years 2011-2017 had yet to be finalised by their own enforcement team.“Kering challenges the outcome of the audit report both on the grounds and the amount,” the company said, adding that it “does not have the necessary information” to record a provision against any potential bill for back taxes or penalties.The company has said that LGI is a substantial firm in its own right, with 600 employees handling inventory, billing and supply-chain logistics, with a business model “known to French and other competent tax authorities”.According to reports by France’s Mediapart newspaper and Germany’s Der Spiegel, Kering’s wholesale activities - the sale of products to retailers such as department stores - have come under particular scrutiny.Some business carried out by Kering employees in locations including Milan and Paris was billed through the Swiss unit, incurring lower tax rates, according to those reports.Reuters reported in November that Milan prosecutors were wrapping up their tax probe into Gucci and Kering, which could potentially lead to a trial.Kering is due to report full-year results on February 12.", "article_description": ["The company’s Swiss-based Luxury Goods International subsidiary has been under investigation for allegedly avoiding tax on earnings generated elsewhere."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/gucci-owner-kering-faces-1-6-billion-italian-tax-claim-23649"},

{"article_title": ["The deadly consequences of agrochemical farming in Argentina"], "article_body": "Alfredo Ceran, 63, worked for nine years as a ground crop-duster applying agrochemicals in soybean fields in Monte Maiz, Cordoba. His fingernails are burned. His blood tests have shown residues of glyphosate, chlorpyrifos, azatrine, 2.4-D and cypermethrin. He has had a liver transplant because of cancer, among other major surgeries. He also suffers from non-alcoholic cirrhosis.“In the decade that I spent working I was never given useful or decent protection of any kind, just gloves that I would usually buy for myself,\" Ceran said. \"To save money and time we would mix as much as seven products in the same round of application, when the norm established that you should never mix more than three products at once. We would use all kinds of products mixed, some completely illegal because of its dangers, but effective, and at the end that’s all that matters to them, if the bug or the bad weeds go away or not.”“I felt sick every time I did it, I could tell that it wasn’t good for me, even my boss and the doctors he took me to see said that my sickness wasn't related to the work I did. It was killing me and I still did it because the pay was decent enough, but it's taking my life away.”Ceran believes that the entire system is rigged in favour of agrochemical companies. He thinks the doctors he visited have lied to him about the cause of his disease. Deep inside, he feels it's the intensive farming that gave him all the diseases. The big revolution in agrochemical farming came in the 1990s, when Monsanto, today Bayer-Monsanto, invented the Roundup Ready Plus soybean seed. A genetically modified seed that could be fumigated with the herbicide, Ready Plus is the commercial name for Glyphosate, which Monsanto invented and introduced in the market decades earlier. The combination allowed farmers to kill all the bad weeds without harming the soy, a major change in the way farming was done. Ready Plus introduced the possibility of direct sowing. Ploughing the land was no longer needed. Everything was done chemically. Plough-less farming would reduce soil-loss – that's how agrochemical companies sold Real Plus.In Argentina, the GMO (genetically modified organism) agricultural model was adopted with no one questioning it in 1996. By the early 2000s, it showed convincing results,  changing Argentina’s landscape. The agricultural frontier expanded at 10 percent per year. Though the country in the early 2000s had highest deforestation rates in the world, soy went from being a secondary crop with no major importance, to representing the greatest business opportunity the country had in the last century. The complete agricultural complex, including science institutions and universities shifted focus to the GMO and agrochemical model of farming. Millions of dollars from major players in the game jumped in, financing agronomy faculties and public agricultural institutions throughout the country. About twenty years later,  rural Argentina is living the environmental, but specially the health consequences of a farming model that was designed to maximize profits, while ignoring public health and sustainability aspects. At least 28 million hectares of the GMO crops are farmed in Argentina every year.  More than 300 million of liters of agrochemicals are spread over these crops. And it’s a number that’s increasing, as much as 10 percent per year. That gives on average of 3.5 liters per inhabitant. In the United States, another agricultural country where the GMO’s and agrochemicals are the norm, the average per person is 0.4 liters. Argentina has developed a compulsive habit for such farming, and Bayer-Monsanto, Basf, Dow, Dupont, and Syngenta are the fixers. These companies alone control more than 80% of the market. The profits go abroad. The consequences stay.In 2015, the local authorities of Monte Maiz wanted to know what was happening in the town so they asked for help from the University of Cordoba. A team of doctors and experts went to the town and installed a sanitary camp to study the people of Monte Maiz. Among other discoveries, the experts found that agrochemicals could be found in the soil, air, water and in thousands of blood samples taken from the locals in different parts of the town. But what was most alarming was the amount of population with skin and lung diseases, miscarriages, hypothyroidism, non-alcoholic cirrhosis, and especially breast cancer, colon cancer, and leukemia. In Argentina, according to the National Secretary of Health, cancer death rates are near 12 percent, which means that out of one hundred deaths, twelve persons die of cancer in any given town anywhere in the country. In Monte Maiz, however, the cancer rate turned out to be 55 percent, an alarming number as per the experts who visited the area in 2015. Out of 117 deaths that the town had in 2014, 66 were cancer related.As the research became public, the town declared sanitary emergency. The national authorities denied the results, however, refusing to consider agrochemicals hazardous and rejecting the report for being 'biased' and unscientific. What did change in Monte Maiz was the introduction of some regulations in the agrochemical activity, such as the prohibition of deposits inside the town or the circulation of the machinery used for the fumigations.In Canals, a town about 60 kilometres away from Monte Maiz, it wasn’t until two years ago when people started to connect the dots about why so many neighbors were getting sick and dying.    Nancy Reinaldi, 51, Rene Battaglino, 62, and Maria Angelica Raiteri, 40, are among several dozen residents of Canals who have stood up for their health rights. One of the first things they asked the authorities was to set up a sanitary camp like the one established in Monte Maiz. But they faced rebuke in return. The local mayor is a producer and applier himself. Instead of doing nothing, they interviewed the families of people who had died in the town in one year, asking them what killed their loved ones. They found the same results as in Monte Maiz, 55 percent of the people had died of cancer in Canals.Glyphosate and the rest of the agrochemicals that are used in the crops are carcinogenic, according to the WHO. But that doesn't mean much to the government, which still complies with reasons and justifications presented by the agrochemical industry. The most common response the agrochemical complex presents is that glyphosate is innocuous to humans or the environment. If the authorities accept the chemicals are indeed harmful, the Argentinian government will have to declare a national health emergency, and come up with a concrete plan to reverse the matrix. “We don’t expect to change the agricultural business, we know we don’t have that power. We just want our lives to be respected, to live in a safe environment” says Nancy, who lives with an agrochemical and machinery deposit just a wall away from her house.Nobody in power is listening to them.", "article_description": ["About 95 percent of crops are chemically-induced in Argentina, making it one of the world's leading cereal, corn, and soybean producers.

A spokesman for the US attorney’s office in Brooklyn also declined to comment. In January 2013, Reuters reported that a Hong Kong-based firm that attempted to sell embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran’s largest mobile-phone operator had much closer ties to China’s Huawei Technologies than was previously known.The news comes the same day Britain’s BT Group said it was removing Huawei’s equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G mobile operations and would not use the Chinese company in central parts of the next network. The Huawei statement said Meng, who also has gone by the English names Cathy and Sabrina, was detained when she was transferring flights in Canada. The handset and telecommunications equipment maker said it complies with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and U.S. and other regulations.The arrest drew a quick reaction in Washington. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse praised the action and said that it was “for breaking U.S. sanctions against Iran.” He added: “Sometimes Chinese aggression is explicitly state-sponsored and sometimes it’s laundered through many of Beijing’s so-called ‘private’ sector entities.” U.S. stock futures tumbled, followed by Asian markets, as news of the arrest heightened the sense a major collision was brewing between the world’s two largest economic powers, not just over tariffs but also over technological hegemony. While investors initially greeted the trade ceasefire reached in Argentina with relief, the mood has quickly soured on scepticism that the two sides can reach a substantive deal. S&P500 e-mini futures ESc1 were down almost 2 percent at one point in thin Asian morning trade on Thursday. ", "article_description": ["Canada’s Department of Justice said Meng Wanzhou is facing extradition to the United States.

The company's experimental hiring tool used artificial intelligence to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars - much like shoppers rate products on Amazon, some of the people said.\"Everyone wanted this holy grail,\" one of the people said. \"They literally wanted it to be an engine where I'm going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we'll hire those.\"But by 2015, the company realised its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way.That is because Amazon's computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.In effect, Amazon's system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalised resumes that included the word \"women's,\" as in \"women's chess club captain.\" And it downgraded graduates of two all-women's colleges, according to people familiar with the matter. They did not specify the names of the schools.Amazon edited the programmes to make them neutral to these particular terms. But that was no guarantee that the machines would not devise other ways of sorting candidates that could prove discriminatory, the people said.The Seattle company ultimately disbanded the team by the start of last year because executives lost hope for the project, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Amazon's recruiters looked at the recommendations generated by the tool when searching for new hires, but never relied solely on those rankings, they said.Amazon declined to comment on the recruiting engine or its challenges, but the company says it is committed to workplace diversity and equality.The company's experiment, which Reuters is first to report, offers a case study in the limitations of machine learning. It also serves as a lesson to the growing list of large companies including Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc that are looking to automate portions of the hiring process.Some 55 percent of US human resources managers said artificial intelligence, or AI, would be a regular part of their work within the next five years, according to a 2017 survey by talent software firm CareerBuilder.Employers have long dreamed of harnessing technology to widen the hiring net and reduce reliance on subjective opinions of human recruiters. But computer scientists such as Nihar Shah, who teaches machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University, say there is still much work to do.\"How to ensure that the algorithm is fair, how to make sure the algorithm is really interpretable and explainable - that's still quite far off,\" he said.Amazon's experiment began at a pivotal moment for the world's largest online retailer. Machine learning was gaining traction in the technology world, thanks to a surge in low-cost computing power. And Amazon's Human Resources department was about to embark on a hiring spree: Since June 2015, the company's global headcount has more than tripled to 575,700 workers, regulatory filings show.So it set up a team in Amazon's Edinburgh engineering hub that grew to around a dozen people. Their goal was to develop AI that could rapidly crawl the web and spot candidates worth recruiting, the people familiar with the matter said.The group created 500 computer models focused on specific job functions and locations. They taught each to recognise some 50,000 terms that showed up on past candidates' resumes. The algorithms learned to assign little significance to skills that were common across IT applicants, such as the ability to write various computer codes, the people said.Instead, the technology favoured candidates who described themselves using verbs more commonly found on male engineers’ resumes, such as \"executed\" and \"captured,\" one person said.Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models' judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said. With the technology returning results almost at random, Amazon shut down the project, they said.Other companies are forging ahead, underscoring the eagerness of employers to harness AI for hiring.Kevin Parker, chief executive of HireVue, a startup near Salt Lake City, said automation is helping firms look beyond the same recruiting networks upon which they have long relied. His firm analyses candidates' speech and facial expressions in video interviews to reduce reliance on resumes.\"You weren’t going back to the same old places; you weren’t going back to just Ivy League schools,\" Parker said. His company's customers include Unilever PLC and Hilton.Goldman Sachs has created its own resume analysis tool that tries to match candidates with the division where they would be the \"best fit,\" the company said.Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network, has gone further. It offers employers algorithmic rankings of candidates based on their fit for job postings on its site.Still, John Jersin, vice president of LinkedIn Talent Solutions, said the service is not a replacement for traditional recruiters.\"I certainly would not trust any AI system today to make a hiring decision on its own,\" he said. \"The technology is just not ready yet.\"Some activists say they are concerned about transparency in AI. The American Civil Liberties Union is currently challenging a law that allows criminal prosecution of researchers and journalists who test hiring websites' algorithms for discrimination.\"We are increasingly focusing on algorithmic fairness as an issue,\" said Rachel Goodman, a staff attorney with the Racial Justice Program at the ACLU.Still, Goodman and other critics of AI acknowledged it could be exceedingly difficult to sue an employer over automated hiring: Job candidates might never know it was being used.As for Amazon, the company managed to salvage some of what it learned from its failed AI experiment. It now uses a \"much-watered down version\" of the recruiting engine to help with some rudimentary chores, including culling duplicate candidate profiles from databases, one of the people familiar with the project said.Another said a new team in Edinburgh has been formed to give automated employment screening another try, this time with a focus on diversity.", "article_description": ["Amazon's computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period and taught itself that male candidates were preferable."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-20785"},

AngloGold Ashanti owns the other 45 percent stake in the project, one of Africa's biggest gold mines.Sokimo said the transaction represented an effort by the foreign companies \"to impose themselves, without any prior discussion, in the countries from which the resources that make up their wealth are extracted\".Randgold said that the takeover would not introduce a new partner in the Kibali project, as suggested by Sokimo.\"There are no provisions in the joint venture agreement and the related documentation which give Sokimo any rights resulting from the proposed merger,\" Randgold said.Randgold, which has fallen out with the Congolese authorities this year over the new mining code that hikes taxes and cancels exemptions, said it had consulted with Sokimo, the minister of mines and other parties, in the days following the merger announcement.Congo has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in payouts from international miners in similar instances in the past few years.The same language Sokimo used about asserting rights was echoed by another Congolese state miner, Gecamines, against Freeport, when in 2016 it announced the sale of its stake in the Tenke copper mine to China Molybdenum. Gecamines received $100 million in a settlement.Meanwhile, Gecamines in June agreed to drop legal proceedings to dissolve a joint venture with a subsidiary of Glencore after reaching a settlement that included Gecamines getting a $150 million payment.Shares of Randgold were up 3.6 percent at 5,360 pence at 1807 GMT.Randgold has a stake in several projects in Congo, including the Kibali mine.", "article_description": ["Democratic Republic of Congo opposes Canada’s Barrick Gold to have stake in the Kibali mine owned by the state as a result of the acquisition of  Randgold Resources."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/randgold-faces-pushback-from-congo-over-barrick-takeover-of-drc-mine-20558"},

Dems do nothing....\"In a follow-up tweet he called the \"so called Trade Deals\" struck by Democrats \"the laughing stock of the world!\"On Thursday, Ross said that at Trump's request, his department was looking at alternatives to the harsh penalty he chose to impose.But, he said, \"if we do decide to go forward with an alternative, what it literally would involve would be in planting people of our choosing into the company to constitute a compliance unit and that unit would report back to the Department of Commerce.\"Top Republican and Democrat senators have denounced the compromise and one even vowed to block it.The reprieve for ZTE came just after Washington and Beijing called a halt to a spiraling trade dispute sparked by US accusations of China's unfair practices and the alleged theft of US technology, with Washington suspending plans to impose tariffs on as much as $150 billion in Chinese imports.Trump also faced accusations of quid-pro-quo after pledging to soften sanctions on ZTE just days after AFP reported a Chinese state firm would pour cash into a Trump-tied real estate venture in Indonesia.Lawmakers were incensed by Trump's offer last week to rescue the company and Chinese jobs, which came via Twitter in the midst of the trade talks with Beijing. The president angrily denied back-pedaling.Top Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who chairs a key subcommittee on foreign relations, denounced the move, and vowed lawmakers would work on \"veto-proof legislation\" to stop the deal.Tweeting again on Friday, Rubio again accused the administration of reaching an agreement that was beneficial to China.\"It is a great deal... for #ZTE & China. #China crushes US companies with no mercy & they use these telecomm companies to spy & steal from us,\" he said on Twitter.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also decried the deal.\"If the administration goes through with this reported deal, President Trump would be helping make China great again. Would be a huge victory for President Xi, and a dramatic retreat by Pres Trump,\" he tweeted. \"Both parties in Congress should come together to stop this deal in its tracks.\"Asked by AFP for comment, a Commerce spokesman said no information was available.", "article_description": ["The news comes as the US prepares to send a trade delegation back to Beijing next week to continue talks aimed at defusing a potentially serious trade dispute with China"], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/white-house-has-deal-to-lift-sanctions-on-china-s-zte-report-17747"},

As Sony showed progress across the sectors, the company has achieved a full-fledged comeback,\" Imanaka said.But falling sales of smartphones continued and will likely drop further during the ongoing year.PlayStation 4 sales are also thought to be peaking after its gradual global launch in late 2013 through early 2014.For the year to March 2019, the firm expects a moderate slowdown, with net profit seen falling 2.2 percent to 480 billion yen and operating profit down 8.8 percent to 670 billion yen.Annual sales are expected to drop 2.9 percent to 8.3 trillion yen.The firm said its sales could slow due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and weak sales of mobile devices. Profits from the semiconductors segment were also expected to fall, Sony said.\"Sony recovered sharply but is unlikely to grow at the same pace for the current fiscal year,\" Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at the Ace Research Institute in Tokyo, told AFP before the results announcement.\"Sony needs a fresh driver if the company wants another boost.\"", "article_description": ["Sony says its net annual profits have hit $4.5 billion.

Their profitability is high.\"\"Given super-low interest rates in Japan and Takeda's ample cash flow, I believe the money would be better used than stocked up.

Victor, who\nhas been a group co-managing director for several years, is seen\nas a steady hand unlikely to change course.At the news conference, however, when several questions were\naddressed directly to Victor, Li ended up interrupting his son\nwith his own answers.During his tenure, Li Ka-shing increased the pace of\noverseas acquisitions, helping boost the group's profits with\ngrowth in the European telecoms business offsetting a drop in\nthe value of the British business following Brexit.Through his flagship CK Hutchison, Li controls the biggest\ncontainer port operator in the world, Canadian oil giant Husky\nEnergy Inc, one of Europe's leading telecoms operators,\nas well as infrastructure assets and a long-time interest in\nBritain that saw him awarded a knighthood in 2000.\"Li Ka-shing is remarkable - he's a role model and I regard\nhim as such,\" said Stuart Gulliver, former CEO of HSBC who in a\n38-year career with the bank worked closely with Li.It was HSBC's 1979 sale to Li of a stake in Hutchison\nWhampoa, a colonial-era trading house, that vaulted him into the\nfirst rank of Chinese tycoons.Commending Li's long laid-out succession plan, unusual among\ntycoons in a region where discussing death is often viewed as\nunlucky, Gulliver praised Victor for being extremely capable.Reinforcing the view that the transition will be seamless,\nVictor said: \"Tomorrow morning when I go to work there won't be\nany difference ... (My father and I) are also\nupstairs-downstairs neighbours, how could we not chat?\"The news of retirement came together with the announcement\nof better-than-expected results at some of Li's biggest firms.CK Hutchison reported a 6 percent rise in 2017 profit to\nHK$35.1 billion ($4.48 billion), versus the average forecast of\nHK$34.63 billion from 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.The real estate arm CK Asset Holdings Limited saw\nannual profits surge 55 percent, also beating estimates.\"Healthy and synchronised growth in major economies gathered\npace in 2017. Provided this trend continues and inflation\nremains benign, the environment in 2018 should remain supportive\nfor global trade and for our businesses,\" Li said.He declined to forecast, however, whether the red-hot local\nproperty market, one of the world's most expensive, had peaked.\"I dare not speculate on property prices ... property prices\nhave gone out of reach for the public,\" he said, while urging\nthe government to build more public housing.Li, who ranked 23rd on the world's rich list by Forbes, is\nthe wealthiest tycoon in Hong Kong, a former British colony that\nreturned to China in 1997.Over the past few years, Li's close ties with Beijing's\nCommunist Party leadership have come under scrutiny.

You have to regrow your industries.\"Increased foreign production, especially by China, has driven down prices and hurt US producers, creating a situation the Commerce Department has called a national security threat.However, critics raised the spectre of a trade war, suggesting other countries would retaliate or use national security as a reason to impose trade penalties of their own.\n reports from Washington DC.China has already threatened to curb imports of US soybeans, while the EU has said it will consider action as well. The Trump administration held \"frank and constructive\" talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser, Liu He, on Thursday, a White House official said.\"We underscored the importance of achieving balance and reciprocity in the economic relationship,\" the official said of the meeting between Liu He and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. \"We discussed ways to ensure fair and reciprocal trade.\"The move will not directly hit China that hard, with data showing that Canada supplies 16 percent of US demand versus China's two percent and is by far the largest steel exporter followed by Brazil and South Korea.\"Should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminium products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a sharply worded statement.Statement by Canada on steel and aluminum: Brazil's industry ministry said it would consider taking action on its own over the tariffs or in concert with other countries. Two of its largest steelmakers, Cia Siderurgica Nacional and Usiminas sold off on the tariff news, closing down 4.4 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively.Washington is already engaged in a dispute with Canada and Mexico over its proposed revision to the North American Free Trade Agreement and months of tense talks have failed to produce any meaningful progress. Overseas, Trump's words brought a stinging rebuke from the president of the European Commission. Though the president generally focuses on China in his trade complaining, it was the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker who denounced his plan as \"a blatant intervention to protect US domestic industry.\"Juncker said the EU would take retaliatory action if Trump followed through.Asked whether there would be exemptions for any countries, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she would not get into any details ahead of next week’s announcement. She said the tariffs were still being finalised.News of the tariffs drove the stocks of US domestic steel and aluminium makers sharply higher, but also hit sentiment on Wall Street due to the potential impact of higher costs on consumers.The threat of tariffs was sharply criticised by some senior Republican legislators as well as industries from autos to oil whose input costs will rise. A major concern is that US farm exports could be hit hard in retaliation by steel-exporting countries.After Trump's statement, AK Steel Holding was up almost 10 percent, US Steel Corp was up over five percent and Nucor rose 3.2 percent. By contrast shares of steel consumers fell with Ford Motor Co down over three percent and General Motors Co down almost four percent.Trump believes the tariffs will safeguard American jobs but many economists say the impact of price increases for consumers of steel and aluminium, such as the auto and oil industries, will be to destroy more jobs than they create.\"This is going to have fallout on our downstream suppliers, particularly in the automotive, machinery and aircraft sectors,\" said Wendy Cutler, a former US trade official who is now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"What benefits one industry can hurt another. What saves one job can jeopardise another.\"Steel-consuming companies said steel tariffs imposed in 2002 by President George W Bush ended up wiping out 200,000 US jobs.The decision had been strenuously debated within the White House, with top officials such as economic adviser Gary Cohn and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis raising concerns.The penalties were pushed by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, an economist who has favoured taking aggressive action.Mattis, in a memo to Commerce, said US military requirements for steel and aluminium represent about three percent of US production and that the department was \"concerned about the negative impact on our key allies\" of any tariffs. He added that targeted tariffs would be preferable to global quotas or tariffs.Plans for Trump to make an announcement were thrown into doubt for a time because of the internal divisions. The actual event caught some top White House officials off guard and left aides scrambling for details. Key Senate offices also did not receive advance notice.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the decision \"shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone,\" noting that the president had been talking about it \"for decades.\"But some Republicans in Congress were plainly upset.\"The president is proposing a massive tax increase on American families. Protectionism is weak, not strong,\" said Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska. \"You'd expect a policy this bad from a leftist administration, not a supposedly Republican one.\"GOP Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said \"every time you do this, you get a retaliation and agriculture is the No 1 target.\"Trump met with more than a dozen executives, including representatives from US Steel Corp, Arcelor Mittal, Nucor, JW Aluminum and Century Aluminum. The industry leaders urged Trump to act, saying they had been unfairly hurt by a glut of imports.\"We are not protectionist. We want a level playing field,\" said Dave Burritt, president and chief executive officer at US Steel.Trump last year ordered an investigation into whether aluminium and steel imports posed a threat to national defence. Ross said last month that the imports \"threaten to impair our national security,\" noting, for example, that only one US company now produces a high-quality aluminium alloy needed for military aircraft.Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president has the authority to restrict imports and impose unlimited tariffs if a Commerce Department investigation finds a national security threat.Commerce recommended a number of options. The president's plan is more stringent than any of them.It was the latest move by the president to engage in trade actions after campaigning to revitalise the \"forgotten\" workers of the country. Trump earlier raised duties on Chinese-made washing machines, solar modules and some aluminium and steel products to offset what he said were improper subsidies.", "article_description": ["President Donald Trump says the US  would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on imported aluminium next week,  as global leaders mulled taking punitive measures."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/americas/global-trade-war-looms-after-trump-orders-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminium-15588"},

In December, hedge fund manager Crispin Odey argued that Sky was being sold too cheaply.Britain's competition regulator said in January that Murdoch's planned takeover should be blocked unless a way was found to prevent him from influencing the network's news operation, Sky News.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that the deal would give Murdoch, who has been trying to buy Sky for eight years, too much influence and so would not be in the public interest.Murdoch's news outlets are watched, read or heard by nearly a third of Britons and have a combined share of public news consumption that is significantly greater than all other news providers, except the BBC and commercial TV news provider ITN.Last week, Fox made further concessions, with a promise to maintain and fund a fully independent Sky-branded news service for 10 years.Comcast said it had only a minimal presence in the British media market and did not see any plurality concerns over its proposal.Comcast said it recognised thatSky News was an \"invaluable part of the UK news landscape\" and it intended to maintain Sky News' existing brand and culture, as well as its strong track record for high-quality impartial news and adherence to broadcasting standards.\"Our strong market positions are complementary with Sky’s leadership in Europe enhancing our preeminent position in the US.\" ", "article_description": ["Comcast Corp, the biggest cable operator in the United States, offered on Tuesday to pay $31 billion to buy Sky, challenging Rupert Murdoch's Fox and Bob Iger's Walt Disney for the European pay-TV jewel."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/comcast-makes-31-billion-bid-for-sky-15516"},

{"article_title": ["Turkish Foreign Minister says Netanyahu and Trump support Iran protests"], "article_body": "Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu met with media representatives in Ankara today and spoke about Turkey’s stance on critical issues such as Iran protests, a transition period in Syria, relations with the US and Trump’s Jerusalem decision.Talking about the protest in Iran, Cavusoglu said that Turkey wished for the unrest in Iran to come to an end and stability to be resored immediately. He said that the Iranian government was democratically elected by the people and added that, “So, if there were to be a change in government, Iranian people could make it happen in the next elections.”After underlining the importance of democratic elections, he criticised Israel and the US for supporting the protests and their double standards.He drew attention to two leaders openly supporting the unrest in Iran, saying “One of them is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the other is the US President Donald Trump.”Cavusoglu also criticised the double standards of some other countries, without naming them, regarding Iranian protests and gave Egypt as an example.“There is praise for them [Egypt] in other countries, but there is criticism against Iran and the government there, as well as external intervention. We find Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s statements positive,” he said.Cavusoglu has talked his counterpart Zarif on the second day of the protests. Zarif has said that Iran was acting carefully against demonstrators. He added that Iran was not opposing peaceful protests by staying open to dialogue with protestors.The visa crisis between Turkey and the US, which had lasted for nearly two months, ended last Thursday. But there was an inconsistency with the written statement by both sides.The US embassy in Turkey released a written statement to declare a restart of visa applications in Turkey. The statement said, “We have received initial high-level assurances from the government of Turkey that there are no additional local employees of our mission in Turkey under investigation.”However, the written statement from Turkish embassy in Washington, which came around 40 minutes later, said it had not given the United States any assurances, and that any decision regarding legal procedures on US mission workers would be left to Turkey’s judiciary. The statement also criticised the US embassy in Turkey saying, “Despite our previous clarifications to the contrary, it is inappropriate to misinform Turkish and American public that such assurances were provided.”When asked about this inconsistency, Cavusoglu said Ankara conveyed the information that no employees in the US missions in Turkey are under investigation but at the same time he denied calling it as an assurance.“[They asked] ’If any other Turkish citizen who work for us is under investigation. Can you inform us about that?’… They asked when they [The US delegation] came here. Our Interior and Justice ministers took on it and told them that there is no such investigation on your employees. Even if there is or is not, those kinds of information sharing can always happen. That’s not an assurance.”Russia is spearheading a conference to talk about the future and a transition period for Syria. The YPG, which is the Syrian affiliate of the PKK, claimed that they were invited as well. PKK is a designated terror organisation by Turkey, the US and the EU, which has been fighting the Turkish state for more than 30 years.“Turkey certainly rejects a terrorist group to attend Sochi conference,” Cavusoglu said. “YPG will not attend, but other Kurdish groups such as Syrian National Kurdish Coalition will be there‘’ he added. He did not deny that Russia has a relation with the YPG.He also talked about future of Syria, ‘’I believe that we will come to a very important progress in 2018. According to [previous] Sochi Declaration, Syria should prepare for the elections with a transparent process under the UN monitoring. All parties should vote in the elections in Syria.”The foreign minister also highlighted Turkey’s leading role in denouncing the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocate Washington’s embassy from Tel Aviv to the contested city.\"Turkey has been the country to display the most vivid stance against the decision. The support of the Vatican, the Western countries as well as the entire world was gained with the efforts of our president,” Cavusoglu said.Cavusoglu criticised the US administration for threatening the entire world after UN General Assembly members recently voted overwhelmingly against the decision.\"In fact, some countries, even great countries said 'We are resisting but the US is pressuring too much and we do not know how long we can resist',\" Cavusoglu added.The foreign minister also highlighted Turkey’s geopolitical significance for Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq and said, “Without Turkey, KRG is nothing… Turkey is a gate to the world for [KRG]. They can’t go out without Turkey’s permission.”“Turkey will extend all kinds of support for stability of Iraq,” Cavusoglu said, adding his country would also continue supporting Turkmen people in Iraq.", "article_description": ["Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that Turkey was always against external interventions and added that all countries except for Netanyahu and Trump were being “cautious” in the face of protests in Iran."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/turkey/turkish-foreign-minister-says-netanyahu-and-trump-support-iran-protests-13885"},

In all, 15 individuals face charges, including Eni's current and former CEOs.According to Milan prosecutors, $520 million of the $1.1 billion paid into an escrow account was converted into cash and distributed as bribes, while several hundred-million more went to a former oil minister.Both Anglo-Dutch Shell and Italy's Eni issued separate statements denying wrongdoing and expressing confidence that the court would exonerate the individuals charged and the companies themselves. Both companies are also under investigation in the case in the Netherlands and face charges in Nigeria.Eni said its board \"reaffirmed its confidence that the company was not involved in alleged corrupt activities in relation to the transaction,\" and added that independent advisers had investigated the deal and found no culpability.Eni's board also backed its current CEO, Claudio Descalzi, who recently won reconfirmation as CEO of the company that is 30-percent government-owned. Descalzi's direct predecessor Paolo Scaroni was also charged.Shell said it was \"disappointed by the outcome,\" and said it believed that a trial will find that there is \"no case.\"The Italian charges follow similar indictments last year in Nigeria, but the Nigeria case targets a Shell subsidiary, not the parent. In Nigeria, prosecutors allege bribes of more than $800 million were made to government officials and a businessman for the block's license and that the Nigerian government only got $210 million from the deal.Global Witness, an anti-corruption non-governmental agency that filed a criminal case that aided prosecutors' investigations, said the Milan trial the biggest corporate bribery case in history.\"The Nigerian people lost out on over $1 billion, equivalent to the country's entire health budget, as a result of this corrupt deal,\" Simon Taylor, co-founder of Global Witness, said in a statement. \"They deserve to know the truth about what happened to their missing millions.\"Taylor said the Milan trial would \"act as a warning to others who see corruption as a route for quick financial wins.\"Shares in both companies closed down 0.5 percent.", "article_description": ["Both Anglo-Dutch Shell and Italy's Eni issued separate statements denying wrongdoing and expressing confidence that the court would exonerate the individuals charged and the companies themselves."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/eni-and-shell-to-be-tried-in-italy-on-corruption-allegations-13479"},

He was also charged with illegal association.Three other individuals have been sentenced to 14 months in prison in the same case, their sentences lightened by \"effective cooperation\" with authorities, according to the verdict read by judge Edgar Flores.In an October interview from prison in Quito, Glas told AFP he was a victim of the construction giant's revenge after he was instrumental in kicking the company out of Ecuador in 2008 following a dispute over repair of a hydroelectric plant.Glas, who was minister of strategic sectors before becoming vice president in 2013, denied any link to the Odebrecht scandal, though his uncle, Ricardo Rivera, has been arrested for his alleged involvement. Under investigation by the US Justice Department, Odebrecht agreed in December to pay a record $3.5 billion fine after admitting to paying $788 million in bribes across 12 countries to secure contracts.The scandal has ensnared politicians in several countries, including Mexico, Peru, Panama and Venezuela.Ecuadoran prosecutors said Odebrecht spent $47.3 million in bribes in their country to get public contracts.Ecuador's former president, Rafael Correa, told CNN Spanish from Panama that Glas was a \"political prisoner\" and there was \"no evidence against him.\"He claimed the conviction was a way for his successor, President Lenin Moreno, to seize control of the vice president's office.", "article_description": ["Jorge Glas was handed a six-year jail term for taking bribes worth a total $13.5 million from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/americas/ecuador-vice-president-convicted-of-corruption-13276"},

The overall cost of the transaction rises to $77 billion with the assumption of Aetna's debt.\"The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018,\" CVS said in a statement, adding \"It is subject to approval by CVS Health and Aetna shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\"Talks between the two have been reported since late October, and are believed to have been driven by rumours that online shopping behemoth Amazon would enter the drugstore market.The merger between CVS and Aetna comes amid rising medical costs for many citizens and employers, including prescription medicines, as President Donald Trump vows to undo the Affordable Care Act.The deal is the largest ever in the health insurance space, a spot previously occupied by Express Scripts' buyout of Medco for $29 billion in 2012.The acquisition is historic as a combination of a drug store chain with a massive health insurer. CVS operates 9,700 drugstores across the US and Aetna insures 22 million Americans. The healthcare industry, meanwhile, is preparing for possible cuts to government-funded programs such as Medicaid as a result of Republican tax cuts to public services.\"Today, increasing numbers of consumers are taking on more and more responsibility for paying for their health care as the burden of costs is being shifted to them,\" the statement said, adding that by merging, the company would be better placed to help customers manage their costs.\"With the analytics of Aetna and CVS Health's human touch, we will create a healthcare platform built around individuals,\" said CVS Health President and Chief Executive Officer Larry J. Merlo.Aetna in February announced it had given up its effort to buy rival Humana following 19 months of negotiations, due to opposition by the US Department of Justice which said it would stifle competition.The acquisition would be considered a so-called \"vertical merger\" because the companies operate in non-competing industries.Analysts have said the CVS-Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega-mergers, as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy.Such deals are usually not opposed by the US government but the Department of Justice last month sued to block a merger between telecommunications giant AT&T and entertainment conglomerate Time Warner.", "article_description": ["The deal is the largest ever in the health business.

Samsung tipped record earnings, it’s going to be better in the fourth-quarter, and all that’s been driven by Kwon’s components business,” said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.  Kwon, 64, is seen as the Samsung Group's number two. As well as being chairman of the board and a board director, he heads the components business – including memory chips – and the display business.In a statement, the man known as “Mr Chip” said the time had come to “start anew with new spirit and young leadership.”“We are fortunately making record earnings right now, but this is the fruit of past decisions and investments; we are not able to even get close to finding new growth engines by reading future trends right now,” he added.The world’s biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and TVs is set to smash its annual profit record this year, thanks partly to soaring demand for memory chips. Semiconductors were Samsung’s top earner in the three months through June, making a record $7.20 billion.The global chip industry is undergoing a major shift with Japan’s Toshiba Corp partnering with home rival SK Hynix, and other firms consolidating in search of new growth areas such as artificial intelligence and automobiles.Shares in Samsung, worth about $310 billion, fell 1.5 percent on Friday after hitting an all-time high earlier in the day.The departure of 32-year Samsung veteran Kwon after five years in the top job comes at a time of leadership uncertainty at the company.Choi Gee-sung, Jay Lee’s mentor, quit earlier this year for his alleged role in the bribery scandal, and Samsung Electronics now needs to fill several more key roles with Kwon’s exit.Kwon would serve out his term as chairman of the board and board director until March 2018, the company said.

We looked at that and the results are quite interesting.”He then showed the conference audience a video of images of a rocket taking off in New York City and landing in various places around the world, with words on the screen showing flight times of less than an hour between any two cities on opposite sides of the world. A New York-to-Shanghai trip could be done in 39 minutes, for example.Musk had previously planned to use a suite of space vehicles to support the colonisation of Mars, beginning with an unmanned capsule called Red Dragon in 2018, but he said SpaceX is now focused on a single, slimmer and shorter rocket instead.The rocket would be partially reusable and capable of flight directly from Earth to Mars, could still carry 100 passengers, and could also be used for fast transport on Earth, Musk said.Musk’s SpaceX is one of several ventures that have said they want to open up space routes to Mars.Lockheed Martin Corp announced separate plans for a manned Mars journey on Friday, unveiling concept drawings of a “base camp” space station orbiting Mars and landing craft that would carry four astronauts to the planet’s surface.“We know its cold, it’s pretty inhospitable, so we start with the robots and then we go down with these landers,” Rob Chambers, Lockheed’s director of human space flight strategy, told Australian Broadcasting Corporation in an interview.Chambers gave no date, but the planned mission would be a joint expedition with NASA, which aims to reach Mars during the 2030s.Mars is typically 225 million km from Earth, and landing the first humans there, after what traditionally has been seen as a six- to nine-month journey, is an extremely ambitious goal.SpaceX, which Musk founded with the aim of colonizing Mars, is one of several private and government-funded ventures vying to put people and cargo on the red planet, and other destinations beyond Earth’s orbit.Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin space venture is also designing a heavy-lift vehicle called New Armstrong that will be capable of Mars transport.Russia and China are each preparing for manned missions to the moon, and Russia has agreed to work with NASA planning a “deep space gateway” space station in lunar orbit, which would serve as a staging post for future missions.", "article_description": ["Musk says, “If you build a ship that’s capable of going to Mars, what if you take that same ship and go from one place to another on Earth?

But this time, he wears the weary countenance of a man nearly broken.\"This is the last time for me,\" he says. \"It's emotionally draining. I just can't do it anymore.\"Over a week after Harvey poured more than 121 centimetres of rain on Houston, killing at least 65 people, destroying thousands of cars and leaving hundreds of thousands of families with flood-damaged homes, America's fourth-biggest city is striving to reopen for business.Houston's airports and shipping lanes reopened to limited traffic last week. Some workers returned to their offices Thursday or Friday. More followed on Tuesday after a long Labor Day weekend of cleanup and regrouping.With waters receded, some parts of the sprawling metropolitan area look virtually untouched. Yet in other places, such as the leafy bedroom community of Kingwood or the Meyerland neighbourhood, piles of debris sit above curbs, industrial-size dumpsters dot shopping centre parking lots and the air is thick with the odor of mold and decay.\"I'm encouraging people to get up and let's get going,\" Mayor Sylvester Turner said over the weekend. \"Most of the city is dry. And I'm saying to people, if you can open, let's open up and let's get started.\"Many big businesses will likely recover relatively quickly. But small companies will struggle to replace moldy carpets and damaged equipment, to reconnect with suppliers, to meet payroll and to draw back customers, many of whom are nursing financial injuries of their own — swamped cars, flooded basements, leaky roofs.Some companies are still too overwhelmed to resume business, which means their employees remain idle and unpaid.\"The big boxes and big chains can absorb hits like this; small businesses can't,\" says Craig Fugate, who served as administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Obama administration. \"Some will make the decision not to reopen. Others won't be able to.\"FEMA estimates that nearly 40 percent of small businesses never reopen after a disaster.On Wednesday, Jucker hopes to reopen the bakery, which his father and two uncles founded 68 years ago.Over the weekend, the place was a wreck. Jucker tossed a ruined loaf of bread into a dumpster and pointed to a jug of blue food dye that will have to go, too. Also ruined is an icemaker, upended by flood waters. Bees swarmed garbage bags full of rotting confectionary and baking ingredients. Cream puffs and Danishes wilted on racks in the parking lot.The bakery lost the live yeast used for sourdough bread; Jucker will have to grow more. It had been roasting its own coffee but lost $15,000 worth of beans. A remodeled cafe at the front of the bakery was mostly destroyed. One of the bakery's four industrial ovens has to be replaced at a cost of more than $50,000. A second one needs at least a new motor, if not a full replacement.Across town, Michael Kaufman is counting his own losses. Flood waters drenched his 29-year-old business, Wholesale Cleaners, ruining the carpet, warping the counters and wrecking the computer inside his $40,000 Unipress machine. The damage comes to about $10,000.From his son's home, where he had taken refuge, he watched the nightmare unfold on the shop's digital cameras. First, the yellow lines in the parking lot disappeared in the rain. Then the water seeped inside.The cleaners, situated in the Jewish community of Meyerland, had always enjoyed good fortune. In the past when storms hit Houston, they flooded the opposite bank of Brays Bayou. This time, water went everywhere.\"It was a lake here,\" Kaufman says.Next, Kaufman faced an odd problem: Flood victims started dropping off mounds of wet shirts and slacks, some so sodden they needed to be cleaned twice. One longtime customer brought four racks of clothes.But what sounds like a windfall isn't. Kaufman knows it may be weeks before those customers — many of them distracted and financially squeezed by home repairs — will return to pick up their clothes and pay for the cleaning. Some might never return.Kaufman worries that some of his clients will give up on Houston and its hurricanes and move away. That's what happened in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina brutalised that city in 2005.In the meantime, Kaufman faces a cash crunch. And he has to meet payroll Friday.\"I'm worried about the business,\" he says.Kaufman's anxiety led him to seek information about a loan from the US Small Business Administration, which has sent teams to Houston to provide emergency credit to businesses and homeowners. The SBA finances the replacement of damaged property and equipment and offers working capital loans to help businesses through the disaster. The interest rate on SBA business loans is just over 3.3 percent, only about half the rate on comparable loans from private-sector lenders.As of early Tuesday, the SBA had approved 19 low-interest Harvey-related business loans worth $1.7 million.\"We have to get people to apply,\" says Michael Flores, a spokesman for the SBA disaster loan program. Often, he says, \"they are just overwhelmed.\"In the short term, some Houston businesses may actually benefit in the aftermath of Harvey. Thousands of Houstonians need new cars to replace those submerged in floodwater. More need to replace carpet, drywall, roofs — even entire homes.\"Anybody's who's got any type of construction or cleanup business — they're going to go off the charts,\" says Fugate, the former FEMA administrator. \"That's going to skyrocket.\"Peyton Williams, a project manager for a Houston contractor, says he's hiring labourers as fast as he can, offering $150 a day through Facebook advertisements. On Saturday, he hired 50 labourers to do demolition work at a damaged apartment complex.\"For blue-collar construction, we're already working,\" Williams says, taking a break from work inside a damaged factory on Houston's north side. \"Everybody wants to get back to work as fast as they can.\"The businesses that reopen the fastest stand to gain an advantage. In hard-hit Kingwood, the Jason's Deli outlet reopened Thursday after a thorough cleanup. Unlike nearby competitors, the deli was spared any flood damage. For now, says Mark Livingston, a managing partner, there aren't many other options for residents who want or need to eat out.The owners of Chic Tailors, near Brays Bayou in Meyerland, didn't wait for help. When Maria Tran and her family couldn't find a contractor, they went to work themselves, measuring and cutting Sheetrock to replace a soggy section of wall. Never mind that Tran is nine months pregnant. Even her 3-year-old son, Ander, chipped in, taking out the trash and keeping watch over the others.Tran wants to reopen the shop quickly so her sister can take over while she gives birth to her second child. She worries because she watched customers move away after previous floods. But she says that \"compared with other people, we're lucky we're still here and alive.\"Smartphones and the internet allowed professional firms to keep going after disaster struck. When Harvey closed the Houston offices of the Jackson Walker law firm, top managers stayed in touch with twice-a-day phone calls.One lawyer checked into a downtown hotel after Harvey forced him from his home and visited the empty office to inspect the computer equipment. He displayed the hardware to the firm's technology staff in Dallas via smartphone video, allowing them to diagnose problems.For some companies, the full scope of the hardship inflicted by Harvey won't be clear anytime soon. Will a flood-damaged strip mall come back? Or will it succumb to the damage it endured, imperiling the stores and restaurants that rent space there?\"The weeding-out process takes about two years,\" Fugate says. Bankruptcies typically rise in the aftermath of natural disasters as companies and households buckle under financial stress.How long will take for Houston to return to business as usual?\"I don't even want to guess,\" says Roberta Skebo, deputy director of the University of Houston's Small Business Development Center, which counsels businesses. \"This is going to be a long process.\"", "article_description": ["Many big businesses will likely recover relatively quickly.

The five year-sentence is one of the longest prison terms given to a South Korean business leader.The Seoul Central District Court said Samsung's financial support of entities backed by Park's close friend, Choi Soon-sil, constituted bribery, including $6.4 million (7.2 billion won) in sponsoring the equestrian career of Choi's daughter.In return for the contributions, prosecutors say, Samsung sought government support for a controversial 2015 merger of two of its affiliates, which helped Lee tighten his control of the conglomerate.His lawyers had argued that the merger was done on business merits but the court did not accept that.Samsung Electronics did not have any immediate comment. Park, who was forced from office in disgrace, is her own corruption trial, with a ruling expected later this year.Prosecutors have argued that Park and Lee took part in the same act of bribery so Lee's conviction would appear ominous for Park.Hundreds of diehard Park supporters rallied outside the court earlier in the day to demand Lee's acquittal.    \"The trials of former president Park Geun-hye and Samsung Jay Y Lee go hand in hand,\" said Son Tong-sok, 63, who heads a conservative group.Son said prosecutors had built their cases on circumstantial evidence and unsubstantiated claims reported in the media.\"Arresting these two innocent people are violations of human rights.\" he said. Samsung, founded in 1938 by Lee's grandfather, is a household name in South Korea and a symbol of the country's dramatic rise from poverty following the 1950-53 Korean War.But over the years, it has also come to epitomize the cosy ties between politicians and powerful family-controlled business groups – or  – which have been implicated in a series of corruption scandals.South Koreans, who once applauded the  for catapulting the country into a global economic power, now criticize them for holding back the economy and squeezing smaller businesses.South Korea's new president, Moon Jae-in, who replaced Park after a May 9 election, has pledged to rein in the , empower minority shareholders and end the practice of pardoning corporate tycoons convicted of white-collar crime.", "article_description": ["South Korean court says Samsung's Jay Y Lee had given bribes to win former president's support.

{"article_title": ["Rwanda's essential oils offer big profits from little land"], "article_body": "Inside a metal shed in southeastern Rwanda, Nicholas Hitimana brandished a plastic container holding a green liquid: geranium essential oil, freshly distilled and ready for export at more than $200 (175 euros) a kilo.The pioneer of essential oils in Rwanda, Hitimana said he understood over a decade ago \"the need to develop high-value crops\" in his hilly nation of just 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres). Agriculture accounts for nearly a third of GDP and employs four-fifths of the population and, as a result, there is \"little arable land\" remaining.\"On a hectare, if we grow beans, we earn about $2,000 a year, whereas on the same land, if we grow geranium, the income can reach $6,000 or even $8,000,\" Hitimana says.The trained agronomist embodies Rwanda's ambition of diversifying its agriculture and increasing the value of exports by getting into the lucrative global market for essential oils. To this end, Hitimana has been importing geraniums from South Africa since 2004.At the time, the flower was virtually unknown in Rwanda, but Hitimana was convinced of the \"great potential\" of the essential oil sector.\"In South Africa there can only be two harvests a year, but here, as there is no winter, it is possible to get up to four crops a year,\" says Hitimana, whose company Ikirezi Natural Products has since grown and diversified.With 25 hectares (61 acres) of plantations, it produces 1,000 kilogrammes of essential oils derived from patchouli, lemon grass and eucalyptus as well as geraniums. The oils are exported to Canada, South Africa, the US and elsewhere for use in the perfume industry.The company employs 70 farmers. \"At first, it was not easy to convince them to abandon subsistence for commercial agriculture,\" he says, adding the work is more precise than growing beans.\"We need to plant on time, manure on time, hoe, turn the soil, irrigate and harvest on time\", or risk a \"drastically\" reduced yield, Hitimana says, noting that it takes between 600-1,000 kilos of geraniums to produce a single kilo of oil.A few years on, and the employees seem convinced. \"Since I've been working here, I've been able to build a house with a tin roof, I can pay for my son's schooling and buy everything I need,\" says 55-year-old Stephanie Mukamana, busily weeding around a geranium plant.Last year, Rwanda exported around 14 tonnes of essential oils  geranium, moringa, patchouli and tagetes  bringing in $473,000, according to the National Agricultural Export Development Board.Rwanda is also cultivating pyrethrum, used in natural insecticides.According to the India-based firm Market Research Future (MRFR), essential oils are increasingly in demand in richer countries for use in cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals. The world market is forecast to grow by seven percent between 2017 and 2022, says MRFR.To get its share of the cake, Rwanda opened an essential oil laboratory three years ago, the first of its kind in the region, allowing quality control.\"One of the main challenges facing Rwanda is a growing trade deficit and a limited number of competitive companies that can meet regional and international export standards,\" says Patience Mutesi, Rwanda director for TradeMark East Africa, which promotes regional trade and helped fund the lab project.The laboratory will \"enable Rwandan companies to access new and lucrative markets ... by strengthening consumer confidence in the quality of Rwandan products,\" she says.Sitting in front of a brand new chromatogram in the Kigali laboratory, Antoine Mukunzi, a Rwanda Standards Authority official, is satisfied with his small country's progress: \"We cannot compete in terms of exported volumes, but we can in terms of quality.\"", "article_description": ["Is this the way forward for the central African country – crops that have a high value and require little land?

Scaramucci, a former Wall Street financier, was named as the administration's new top communications official.A Republican close to the White House told Reuters that Trump settled on Scaramucci for the job on Thursday and met with him on Friday morning to formally offer it to him.After news of Scaramucci's hiring leaked, the official said, Spicer met with Trump in the Oval Office and basically \"gave an ultimatum\" that it was \"him or me.\" When Trump would not budge, Spicer resigned, the official said.The 45-year-old Spicer, a veteran Washington staffer, was parodied memorably by actress Melissa McCarthy on the \"Saturday Night Live\" TV comedy show for his combative encounters with the White House press corps.Trump said he was grateful for Spicer's work in a statement, delivered at the briefing by Sanders.Scaramucci told reporters, \"I love the president. ... It's an honour to be here.\" Asked how he was going to right the White House ship, Scaramucci said there was nothing to fix.\"The ship is going in the right direction. I like the team. Let me rephrase that: I love the team,\" he said.Scaramucci said he has worked to make sure he has no conflicts of interests stemming from his wide-ranging business activities.

But Oregon does not direct police to use that money to investigate black-market pot operations.Colorado's fund is the first in any state designated to specifically combat the black market. Colorado gave law enforcement about $1.7 million last year for other marijuana-related enforcement activities, such as training officers to spot stoned drivers.The blackmarket grants are aimed at rural communities, where there may be no pot dispensaries and no local tax benefit from legalisation.Rural communities have also attracted some high-profile illicit drug operators accused of trying to exploit Colorado's pot law to produce marijuana for sale out of state. The small towns where this has happened have limited police resources and their officials have said they cannot thorough investigate some sprawling marijuana growing operations.\"An investigation like this can be very time-consuming and expensive,\" said Michael Phibbs, head of the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police.The US government allowed Colorado's marijuana legalisation experiment on the condition that state officials act to prevent marijuana from migrating to other states where it is still outlawed and ensure that criminal cartels are kept out of the growing business.The pot industry acknowledges the criminal activity and insists it is doing all it can to prohibit legally grown weed from crossing state lines. Among other safeguards, Colorado law requires growers to get licences and use a \"seed-to-sale\" tracking system that monitors marijuana plants from when they are grown to when the finished product is sold in retail outlets.\"The blackmarket certainly hurts the regulated industry,\" said Kevin Gallagher, head of the Cannabis Business Alliance, a Colorado group representing the sector.A dozen raids across southeast Colorado in 2016 led federal authorities to seize more than 10,000kg of marijuana they said were intended for out-of-state sale.There have been debates in some states over racial disparities in drug arrests after legalisation.But the Colorado bill's sponsor said the extra funding for police is not meant to jail more people. Instead, it is aimed at helping rural areas ill equipped to investigate possible multinational drug operations, she said.In Colorado, \"to my knowledge there is no evidence that illegal growing disproportionately affects minority communities,\" said Senator Irene Aguilar, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the bill.Hickenlooper was also scheduled to sign a bill Thursday that limits the amount of marijuana that can be grown in most homes to 12 marijuana plants no matter how many people might be living there. Current state law allows adults over 21 to possess six plants each and more if doctors recommend a higher plant count.The 12-plant residential limit is already required by local zoning laws in most of Colorado's larger communities, including Denver. That makes it unclear how many people would be affected by the statewide limit.

The producer group has been battling a global glut of crude after seeing prices halve and revenues drop sharply in the past three years.The cuts are likely to be shared again by a dozen non-members led by top oil producer Russia, which reduced output in tandem with OPEC from January. Non-OPEC producers meet OPEC later on Thursday.OPEC's cuts have helped push oil from $26 a barrel in early June 2016 to back above $50 a barrel this year, giving a fiscal boost to producers. Many of the producing countries rely heavily on energy revenues and have had to burn through foreign-currency reserves to plug holes in their budgets.In the latter half of 2016, the 24 countries, including the OPEC cartel and Russia, agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day in order to reduce global oil inventories to the five-year average.The earlier decline in oil price, which started in 2014, forced Russia and Saudi Arabia to tighten their belts and led to unrest in some oil-producing countries, including Venezuela and Nigeria.The price rise this year has spurred growth in the US shale industry, which is not participating in the output deal. This has slowed the market's rebalancing with global crude stocks still near record highs.On Thursday, Riyadh's energy minister Khalid al Falih said at the OPEC meeting that he expected the extension to ease the global crude glut sufficiently by early 2018.\"All the simulations that have been done by OPEC and non-OPEC experts ... demonstrated that we will be within the five-year average in the first quarter of next year,\" Falih said.Falih told reporters at the start of the meeting at the headquarters of OPEC that this was \"almost certain ... to do the trick.\"Falih is not worried that higher oil prices helped rival shale oil producers in the United States to increase their output and slow down the reduction in inventories.\"Shale is an important variable but we don't believe it is going to significantly derail or affect what we are doing,\" he said.In London late morning, Brent Crude, the global benchmark, was down 38 cents at $53.58.

Under United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) guidelines, EB-5 investors must put their capital at risk and the green card is not guaranteed. USCIS is part of the Department of Homeland Security.Qiaowai's promotional materials online and on social media, including for the One Journal Square project, sometimes referred to a green card guarantee or \"safeguard\" and the safety of capital invested in EB-5 projects. These phrases were deleted after Reuters drew attention to them.Qiaowai's assurances to investors that their green cards were guaranteed and their funds were safe appeared to violate US securities laws, Grassley's letter said.Chinese investors account for around 80 percent of the nearly 10,000 EB-5 visas issued annually.", "article_description": ["Two men are missing, and one man has been arrested on suspicion of illegally using eavesdropping equipment while investigating labour conditions in companies that produce shoes for Ivanka Trump's brand."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/asia/activist-probing-factories-making-ivanka-trump-shoes-in-china-arrested-368793"},

Economists had forecast that it would increase, but only to 114.1.Ifo said it was the highest figure since 1991, and, along with other data, points to growth of 0.6 percent in the second quarter, matching the quarter-on-quarter growth figure of 0.6 percent for the January-March period.\"Today's strong German data add to the evidence that, not only the German economy, but the entire eurozone economy could become the positive growth surprise of 2017,\" ING-Diba economist Carsten Brzeski said.\"This sentiment is also spreading across financial markets, with many market participants now realising that the eurozone economy had been written off too early.\"The eurozone grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter compared to the quarter before, and 1.7 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.Germany has been the main engine behind the region's recovery from recession which began four years ago.It's been buoyed by strong exports of its cars and machinery. Stronger consumer confidence due to low unemployment of 3.9 percent has also supported the recovery.However, for the region to really push on growth has to come from all corners and a run of surveys are pointing to a pick-up, particularly in France, the eurozone's second-largest economy.The strong data mean the eurozone is closer to no longer needing extraordinary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank through its 60 billion euros ($67 billion) in monthly bond purchases.The purchases pump newly printed money into the economy in an attempt to raise inflation that is considered too weak, and to protect the recovery from any new troubles.The bank has said it will continue the purchases at least through year end. Analysts expect more hints about the bank's future plans at its June 8 meeting and a clear roadmap for tapering the stimulus could emerge in September.", "article_description": ["Key surveys are showing increases in business activity and confidence – not only in Germany, but in other countries in the region."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/optimism-over-eurozone-recovery-7222"},

The arbitration will take place in San Francisco, Western Digital said on Sunday.\"Seeking relief through mandatory arbitration was not our first choice in trying to resolve this matter. However, all of our other efforts to achieve a resolution to date have been unsuccessful, and so we believe legal action is now a necessary next step,\" Chief Executive Steve Milligan said.Toshiba said it expects to return to profit for the fiscal year through March 2018, projecting profit of 50 billion yen ($442 million).Costs in the nuclear industry have ballooned since the March 2011 tsunami in northeastern Japan, when three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant melted down.The disaster caused widespread and long-term environmental damage and contamination, resulting in stricter safeguards for reactor construction and operation, costs owners and operators will eventually want to pass on to consumers.", "article_description": ["The Japanese electronics giant doubled its loss over the previous fiscal year as its investment in a US nuclear firm continues to impact the bottom line."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/business/toshiba-posts-84-billion-loss-356640"},
{"article_title": ["Emirates Airlines profits fall 82 percent"], "article_body": "Emirates, the world's number one airline, said on Thursday that its profits had plunged by 82.5 percent in its last fiscal year, blaming fierce competition, currency devaluation and US travel restrictions.The United Arab Emirates airline which has emerged as a major global carrier operating from its hub in Dubai, said profit stood at $340 million in its fiscal year from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017, down from $1.9 billion in the previous year.The steep drop was the result of the US dollar's \"relentless rise\" against currencies in its key markets and \"fare adjustments due to a highly competitive business environment\", the airline said in a statement.Company chief Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum also pointed to \"destabilising events which have impacted travel demand during the year\".These included Britain's vote to leave the European Union and several terror attacks in Europe, both of which led to a drop in travel demand.\"New policies impacting air travel into the US\" were another issue, he said.Emirates last month reduced its flights to the United States after tightened visa and security measures under President Donald Trump hit demand.At the time, it blamed actions by Washington on the issuance of entry visas and the decision to ban passengers on direct flights from eight countries, including the United Arab Emirates, from carrying laptop computers, tablets and other electronic devices larger than cellphones on board.Despite the challenges, the airline carried a record 56.1 million passengers in 2016-17, up eight percent from the previous year, the statement said.But its passenger seat factor -- the share of the total number of seats on a flight that are filled -- dropped slightly to 75.1 percent as a result of its continued increase in capacity.Emirates is the biggest client for Airbus's A380 superjumbos.The higher passenger capacity also pushed up the carrier's fuel bill by six percent to $5.7 billion, despite a softening in average fuel price, Emirates said.Revenues generated on routes to Europe, the Americas and East Asia/Australasia slightly increased, but income from African and West Asian/Indian Ocean routes declined by four percent and three percent respectively.

The H-1B visas section included no definite timeline, while the government procurement section did.H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in occupations that generally require higher education, including science, engineering or computer programming.The government uses a lottery to award 65,000 visas every year and randomly distributes another 20,000 to graduate student workers.Critics say the lottery benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications for visas for lower-paid information technology workers.\"Right now H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery and that's wrong. Instead, they should be given to the most skilled and highest paid applicants and they should never, ever be used to replace Americans,\" Trump said.Like many of Trump's executive orders to date, the newest decree will have little practical impact, but sends a signal for the various government departments to come forward with ideas for reform.It namely instructs the Labour, Justice and Homeland Security departments to tackle issues in the H-1B system and draw up reforms aimed at bringing the program back to its original intent: awarding visas to the most skilled and highly-paid applicants.\"For too long, rather than operating as designed and allowing only the best and brightest to come in and fill key positions, the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program has been administered in a way that harms American workers,\" a White House official said.Specifically, Trump's administration believes the current system led to a \"flood\" of relatively low-wage, low-skill workers in the tech sector.The US president cannot, by simple decree, change the number of visas allocated. But the White House hopes to spur momentum towards a broader congressional reform — whose outline remains unclear.\"This is a transitional step to get towards a more skill-based and merit-based version,\" a US official said. \"There is a lot we can do administratively, and the rest will be done hopefully legislatively.\"", "article_description": ["US President Trump signs an order known as \"Buy American and Hire American\" that also seeks changes in government procurement that would boost purchases of American products in federal contracts."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/americas/trump-orders-review-of-visa-program-to-encourage-hiring-americans-338568"},

{"article_title": ["Why are airlines allowed to overbook flights and then bump passengers?"], "article_body": "Let's first be clear on overbooking versus oversold. There are almost always no shows on a flight. Not all tickets are nonrefundable, so those may be changed just minutes before a flight is schedule to depart. In addition, since so many passengers make connections, there will always be the chance of people not making it to their scheduled flight at a transfer point.A flight is if there are . A flight is if there are . When a flight is oversold, some passengers will be unable to receive a seat assignment when they check in. (They will get what is called in airline lingo a priority verification card to clear security.)Airlines have been allowed to overbook and even oversell flights by the US DOT (or whatever their governing body), but when they deny someone a seat, they must provide adequate compensation to the inconvenienced passengers. They are also allowed to re-accommodate other passengers who volunteer in order to free up seats for people who have paid reservations but no seat assignments.The airlines have decided that it is in their bests interests to risk the occasional compensation payment in return for increasing the load factors on their flights. I can't say I blame them.When a flight is oversold, people who check in without seat assignments are placed on the standby list, the same as people who might wish to take the 5 p.m. flight instead of the 6:30 p.m. flight they originally booked and those who ran late from home or work and missed their original flight. Importantly, the people with tickets but not seats have a higher priority on the list than people with voluntary changes. If you misconnect through no fault of your own, you will also have a high priority on the standby list if the airline cannot confirm you on another flight. If you misconnect because you took too long at the bar, then that's the same as oversleeping.As the flight processes, people may switch away from the flight. Some connections may become impossible. Some people may not have boarded within the cutoff time (10 minutes for many airlines). These kinds of changes will allow the gate agent to process names from the standby list. If they can process all the involuntary people from the list, then the flight is no longer oversold. Some of the people who were there for voluntary reasons (optional change or late to their original flight) may remain on the list and get rolled over to the next flight.If you are involuntarily bumped from your flight, you will receive compensation. The airline will first seek volunteers willing to travel on a different itinerary for a smaller amount of compensation, but if there are not enough volunteers then involuntary compensation rules will apply. The involuntary compensation rules are significant enough that airlines try to avoid paying it, so they may raise the offer for volunteers until they have enough seats. (Conversely, if there are enough no shows even though you might have volunteered, you will get called up to board at the last minute and no compensation is due.)Even though I have many complaints about the ways airlines run their businesses, most of the time if I have goofed up and been late to a flight (which I can count on a couple of fingers), they have worked with me to find an alternate at no charge. I've also been granted a standby seat on an earlier flight quite a few times, so overall I think I've had things go in my favor far more often than I've been left paying $200 or being told \"too bad, you were late, you have to buy a new ticket.\"The practice of overbooking seems to bother some people quite a bit, but there are plenty of people who love to try and work the system and get a voucher. They are quite happy to fly four hours later if they get a few hundred bucks in travel credit to use for their next trip. I've even accepted an offer of a different routing with first class confirmed all the way through rather than vouchers. In one case, my original connecting flight took a three hour delay so I got home much earlier than had I stayed on my original booking.", "article_description": ["United Airlines removed a passenger from a flight, and it sparked a controversy as to why they'd done it.

The challenge to raise financing remains,\" Bertrand Grabowski, a managing director at German's DVB Bank, said.Foreign banks are reluctant to finance, fearing they could fall foul of remaining US sanctions that still prohibit the use of its financial system for Iranian business, something difficult to avoid in a complex global supply chain.Also, US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is strongly critical of the rapprochement, making some banks fear they could be left with no insurance if Iran sanctions \"snap back,\" according to Reuters.What makes the situation complex is the skepticism of some Republican lawmakers who say Iran uses its commercial aviation to transport weapons and soldiers to terrorist organisations.Two Republican lawmakers even wrote a  to Boeing in June to raise their concern on subjects like how the plane maker would ensure that its jets are not used to help Bashar al Assad's regime in Syria.Iran Air's desire to buy so many aircraft at the same time has also given its detractors a point to ponder upon.As The Washington Institute, a policy think-tank, : \"To put the sale in perspective, Air France has fewer planes than what Iran Air proposes to purchase, so it is not at all clear why the company thinks it can find enough passengers for them.\" Others like  of the American Enterprise Institute believe the deals would allow Revolutionary Guard Corps to get its hands on hundreds of millions of dollars and \"it will not help civilians an iota.\" But then there is another side to the story.Since 1979 Islamic revolution which pitted Iran against the west, the country has found it difficult to buy aircraft and spares.According to  more than 1600 people have been killed in dozens of accidents in last three decades, most of them in the 1990s. That was the time when Iran was dependent on Russian-made aircraft like Ilyushin and Tupolev.Airbus said it had been granted an initial licence to supply 17 A320 or A330 jets that are slated for early delivery, and that it expected a second licence for remaining jets in weeks.Iran has also ordered up to 40 Franco-Italian ATR turboprop planes needing US approval.

{"article_title": ["French labour reform demonstrations likely coming to an end"], "article_body": "Protesters in France on Thursday once again marched against labour reforms that will hurt the workers, but the unions signaled an end to the agitation that has entered into its six month.France has seen violent protests in recent months during which police used teargas and stun grenades to disperse crowds, while hooded youths hurled bottles, beer cans and on occasion makeshift firebombs in demonstrations against a labour law that will make hiring and firing of workers easier.However, the head of the Force Ouvriere union indicated that the focus of opposition would now shift to legal challenges against the application of the new law, and that street marches were at an end.\"We are lifting our foot off the pedal for now. We are not going to do this every week,\" Jean-Claude Mailly told reporters at a rally in Paris's Place de la Bastille square.Unions say the new law will undermine high standards of labor protection as well as their ability to represent workers, notably in small firms where it will give employers more muscle to strike lower-standard deals on issues such as overtime pay.Seven months from a presidential election, Mailly said that the unions would not let Socialist President Francois Hollande and his government off the hook.\"This law will be the chewing gum that sticks to the soles of the government's shoes,\" he told France 2 public television.Mailly and Philippe Martinez, head of the CGT union, said they hoped legal challenges would force the withdrawal of the new law. They intend to challenge application decrees that will spell out exactly how the law applies on the ground.Martinez said the law could be exploited by employers to trim overtime pay from a 25 percent markup to 10 percent.At their peak, the protests brought close to 400,000 people into the streets last March but turnout has waned over time and was in the low thousands in most cities on Thursday according to early readouts from police.Police said between 12,500 and 13,500 marched in Paris.Some 62 people were arrested across the country, the Interior Ministry said. Fifteen gendarmes and police officers were injured, including two who were hospitalized.The new law, which the government says will help lower a jobless rate stuck close to 10 percent, was forced through parliament in July.", "article_description": ["Labour unions signaled their focus will now shift to legal action against application of the law that they claim will hurt the workers."], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/europe/french-labour-reform-demonstrations-likely-come-to-end-187134"},

It also reduced the out-of-pocket costs of EpiPen for some patients last week.Mylans promise of a new generic EpiPen for half the price only further calls into question the excessive price of branded EpiPens.Asked about the letter, Mylan spokeswoman Lauren Kashtan said in an email statement: \"We have acknowledged receipt of letters from congressional offices and intend to respond to them.\"Mylan has defended EpiPen's high price, saying it spent hundreds of millions of dollars to improve the product since acquiring it in 2007. It has also said it recoups less than half the list price for EpiPens.Mylan selling EpiPen for $300 is like an extortionist agreeing to halve its price. The problem is Mylan's monopoly power to set prices.In their letter, the lawmakers asked Mylan how much insurers paid for the EpiPen in 2009 and how much they pay now.They also asked how many EpiPens Mylan provided to low income, uninsured consumers and how many schools purchased EpiPens versus how many received them for free.News about EpiPens started making headlines around the world after users of the drug in the US took to social media with complaints about its high cost.

BP's share price plummeted after the disaster that has cost the company more than $55 billion.BP said in court papers the lawsuit should not be allowed to proceed because the plaintiffs were improperly seeking damages for the entire decline in stock price as a result of the spill.The appeals court said some of the investors might have bought the stock even knowing the risk, and these investors may still sue BP individually. In the same ruling, the appeals court allowed a lawsuit by investors who bought shares after the spill to move forward.The April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and Macondo oil well rupture killed 11 workers and caused the largest offshore environmental disaster in US history, polluting large parts of the Gulf, killing marine wildlife and harming businesses. It took 87 days to plug the leak on the ocean floor.In total, BP has incurred about $55 billion in losses as a result of the spill, including $18.7 billion to settle federal, state and local claims.The case is Ludlow v.

The company sold 300 aircraft worth a record $38 billion during President Xi Jinping's visit to the US in 2015.The China Eastern orders come a day after Boeing reported an 8.8 percent drop in first-quarter earnings to $1.2 billion, partly due to sluggish aircraft deliveries into a slowing global economy.But China hopes some of the massive civil aircraft market will go to its homegrown planes.State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) has already delivered its first domestically-made regional jet, and rolled out a narrow-body C919 plane in November.In the long term COMAC aims to produce an even larger wide-body jet in cooperation with Russia's United Aircraft Corp, whose products include the Sukhoi Superjet 100.China Eastern's announcement late Thursday came alongside its first-quarter results, in which it said net profits rose 66.4 percent year-on-year to 2.6 billion yuan ($400 million).Dai Yaxiong, an analyst at Sinolink Securities, told Agence France Presse: \"China Eastern bought the wide-body aircraft mainly to invest in its international routes as outbound travel is quite hot and the gross profit margins for international flights are much higher than domestic ones.\"Falling fuel prices were the main driver of the rise in profits, he said, adding: \"The demand for civil aviation was also quite stable.\"China Eastern shares were down 0.81 percent in Shanghai by the break on Friday.", "article_description": ["China Eartern Airlines orders $10B worth of planes from Europe's Airbus and US' Boeing"], "article_url": "https://www.trtworld.com/asia/chinese-airline-orders-10b-worth-planes-from-airbus-boeing-96190"},

It was not immediately clear if his release was part of the agreement.His sister, Bilge Nevzat, thanked Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu for their efforts in her brother's extradition and release, local media said.The 74-year-old was jailed for 10 years in 2012 for stealing $41.8 million from Polly Peck, an ailing textiles company, which he transformed into one of the most successful British firms of the 1980s.Its later collapse was one of Britain's biggest corporate failures and was an embarrassment for the Conservative Party, which had accepted big donations from Nadir in the 1980s.Earlier on Friday, a Justice Ministry spokeswoman in Britain said its government policy was to remove foreign criminals to their own countries.\"Arrangements were made with the Turkish government for his removal as part of our prisoner transfer agreement,\" she said.Nadir was escorted to a police station on arrival at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, local media reported.

{"article_title": ["Treasury intervention scuppers $160B Pfizer, Allergan deal "], "article_body": "US drug maker Pfizer Inc agreed on Tuesday to terminate its $160 billion agreement to acquire Botox maker Allergan Plc, in a major victory to US President Barack Obama's drive to stop tax-dodging corporate mergers.The decision to end the biggest tax \"inversion\" ever attempted, which would have seen Pfizer slash its tax bill by redomiciling to Ireland where Allergan is registered, came a day after the US Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.While these new rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan, one of their provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger; Allergan's previous history as a major acquirer of other companies. The subsequent demise of the deal allows Obama to claim a big win during his last year in office.Earlier on Tuesday, Obama called global tax avoidance a \"huge problem\" and urged Congress to take action to stop US companies from tax-avoiding corporate \"inversions,\" which lower companies' tax bills by redomiciling overseas.\"While the Treasury Department's actions will make it more difficult... to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only Congress can close it for good,\" Obama said.Pfizer and Allergan will announce the termination of their deal on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified ahead of any official statement. Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment.Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage the inversion might have provoked new rules by the US Treasury, and so was leaning earlier on Tuesday to end the deal, a source had earlier told Reuters.Pfizer will have to pay Allergan up to $400 million for its expenses as a result of terminating the deal, according to their merger agreement.Pfizer shares had ended trading in New York on Tuesday up 2 percent on hopes the company would walk away or renegotiate the deal in its favour. Allergan shares closed down 14.8 percent to their lowest level since October 2014.Several US presidential candidates, including Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have seized on the issue in their campaigns.\"We have so many companies leaving, it is disgraceful,\" Trump told reporters as he greeted voters in Waukesha, Wisconsin on Tuesday. Clinton and Sanders both expressed support for Treasury's plan.Besides Pfizer-Allergan, other pending inversion deals that have not yet closed include the proposed $16.5 billion merger of Johnson Controls Inc with Ireland-based Tyco International Plc, Waste Connections Inc's $2.67 billion deal with Canada's Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd , and IHS Inc's $13 billion acquisition of London-based Markit Ltd.In all these cases, the shares of the target companies fell only slightly. Johnson Controls and Tyco said they would respond after conducting a review of the new rules.Waste Connections and Progressive Waste Solutions said they expected the rules would impact less than 3 percent of the combined adjusted free cash flow in their first year after the deal.IHS and Markit said they believed the rules would not affect their adjusted effective tax rate guidance of a low to mid-twenties percentage range.Under previous rules which still apply, Allergan shareholders needed to own at least 40 percent of the combined company for the two companies to enjoy the full tax benefits of an inversion, and more than 20 percent to have any inversion benefit at all.But a new \"three-year-look-back rule\" issued by the Treasury on Monday made this much harder for Allergan, and appeared to take aim directly at it because of how the company was put together.The new rule does not allow stock accumulated through a foreign company's US deals in the last three years to count towards the book value needed to meet the inversion threshold.This weighed on Allergan heavily because of its significant deals in this timeframe. These include the $66 billion merger of Allergan and Actavis Plc, the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories and the $5 billion takeover of Warner Chilcott.\"The serial acquisition portion of the regulations will cause Pfizer to be treated as an 'expatriated entity' [under the terms of its existing deal with Allergan],\" Robert Willens, a corporate tax and accounting analyst, wrote in a note.In a second change to the rules, the Treasury also said it would seek to limit a practice known as earnings stripping that is often undertaken following, but not limited to, an inversion. The new Treasury rules would restrict related-party debt for US subsidiaries in dealings that do not finance new investment in the United States.Without Allergan's new, fast-growing medicines, Pfizer may need to look for other companies with attractive products, such as US drugmakers Biogen Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and AbbVie Inc, said Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director of brokerage HC Wainwright.Pfizer had planned to make a decision by 2016 whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines, but delayed the decision until 2019 after announcing its merger with Allergan. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover had said the decision could be moved to late 2017 or 2018 if the deal with Allergan collapsed.Pfizer, which announced the deal in November, had said its tax rate would drop to about 17 or 18 percent after the deal, from around 25 percent. That would have represented more than $1 billion in annual cost savings.The deal's collapse is also a blow to the investment banks involved. Guggenheim Partners LLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Centerview Partners Holdings LLC and Moelis & Co stood to share $94 million in fees advising Pfizer had the deal closed, while Allergan would have paid its advisors, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley, $142 million in total, according to the latest estimates by Freeman & Co LLC.Bankers may now get paid only 10 percent of these amounts, according to Freeman.This is not the first time a tightening of the US inversion rules have caused a merger to unravel.

Next month, we will see lower inflation numbers because of base effects.\" This would lead to further interest rate cuts, he added.ALB Securities analyst Enver Erkan identified food prices and foreign currency levels as two crucial factors in the Turkish economy.\"But we see that core inflation remains way too high, compared to the headline because of the depreciation of Turkish lira compared to last year,\" he said. \"So it means that other factors continue to affect inflation upwards. With the sharp decline in headline inflation, the Turkish Central Bank may be encouraged to cut interest rates but the high core inflation level may limit the interest rate cut.\"The main risk is the additional depreciation of lira but if food prices continue to get better and currency levels stay stable, inflation expectations might be revised downwards to 7.5 to 8 [percent] levels.\"Plummeting oil prices have also played a role in bringing down inflation, reaching less than $30 a barrel earlier this year compared to $115 in June 2014.The Central Bank is likely to maintain tight control on interest rates while core inflation remains high.
